## FINAL NOTES

This website should be more than a digital brochure—it's Watauga County's primary economic development tool for the next decade. It must:

- **Tell a cohesive story** where tourism, lifestyle, and business opportunity reinforce each other
- **Serve multiple audiences** without diluting the core message
- **Showcase authentic character** while projecting professional competence
- **Provide tangible tools** (property search, data, resources) not just marketing speak
- **Reflect community values** (sustainability, education, outdoor lifestyle, innovation)
- **Be maintainable long-term** by Chamber/EDC staff

The three pillars—tourism, mountain living, university town—aren't separate audiences; they're interconnected aspects of what makes Watauga County unique. The website should demonstrate how they strengthen each other: tourists become residents, students become entrepreneurs, quality of life attracts businesses, university creates workforce, outdoor industry drives tourism, etc.
